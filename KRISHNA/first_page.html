<h1>Details Of Dairy Milk Choclates</h1>
<p>
Cadbury Dairy Milk is a British brand of milk chocolate manufactured by Cadbury. It was introduced in the United Kingdom in June 1905 and now consists of a number of products. Every product in the Dairy Milk line is made exclusively with milk chocolate. In 1928, Cadbury introduced the "glass and a half" slogan to accompany the Dairy Milk chocolate bar, to advertise the bar's higher milk content.</p><br>

<p>The bar was developed by George Cadbury Jr, and by 1914 it had become the company's best-selling product.[2] A century on it has retained its position as a market leader in the UK where it was ranked the best-selling chocolate bar 2014.[3] It is manufactured and distributed by the Hershey Company in the United States under licence from Cadbury, with a recipe that differs from the UK version.[4] The chocolate is now available in many countries, including China, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Bangladesh. </p><br>
